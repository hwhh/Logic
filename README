To run basic: first argument is the number of proportional variables and the second is the input forumla. e.g.

                        .\ttable <no_of_vars> <formula>

To run the extension: first argument is the number of proportional variables and the second is the input forumla,
                      the second argument can be either a function name or a formula. Note that if using two input formulas,
                      you must put the second formula as the third program argument, otherwise it can be a function name followed by more
                      function names e.g.

                         .\ttable <no_of_vars> <formula_1> <formula_2(optional)> <function names>....
